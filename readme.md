# CAM

This is a electron app which displays a selected webcam input in a frameless window. If you are a Youtuber/Streamer who does not want to edit anything, this is the perfect program for you.

## How to use:
When the window is focused, the following hotkeys apply: 

| Hotkey | Function                                                 |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| m      | Minimizes the window                                     |
| t      | This hotkey toggles stay-on-top                          |
| s      | Lets you select a different wabcam                       |
| c      | Closes program                                           |

## The .exe in releases is not signed, because I do not have the money for a certificate. Therefore, Windows will show a warning.
